Hey Everyone. Welcome to my journey as a Front-End Developer where I am striving to implement my knowledge by doing some projects. It is a truly tough and thorny way but enormously exciting at the same time.

# Dice Game 

Dice Game or as it also called a Pig Game is one of the oldest and well-known worldwide. Here, in this project, I have implemented some basic functionality so now everyone could start playing and enjoy the game. The inspiration and knowledge for this project comes from Jonas Schmedtmann's complete JavaScript course

### Some basic rules for this game:
1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
2. The players may manually set a desire winning score for a round in input field.
3. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.
4. If the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
5. A player looses his ENTIRE (Global score) score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's next player's turn.
6. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
7. The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
